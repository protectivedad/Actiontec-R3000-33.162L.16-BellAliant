Make sure to install i386 libraries for fakeroot. On Ubuntu these are stored in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libfakeroot which requires:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libfakeroot" fakeroot
This has been changed in the Makefile to use the system fakeroot with the added libraries so 32 bit programs work correctly.

Also bind /bin/bash to /bin/sh for compiling.
  sudo mount --bind /bin/bash /bin/sh

This builds the stock images for the BELL ALIANT R3000H-B0 hub plus a extra flash.tar.gz.

DO NOT USE THESE TO UPGRADE. THE CFE IS BAD AND THE HUB WILL BE DEAD!!!!!

They can be used to pivot under the existing system.

Copy flash.tar.gz to a flash drive.

Put it into the R3000H get telnet access and:
---- commands start ----
gunzip -c /mnt/disk1_1/flash.tar.gz | tar -C /data -xf -

/data/bin/ash
mount -o remount,rw /

cp -ai /data/etc /etc
ln -sf /data/dropbear/scp /bin/scp
mkdir -p /home

mount -o remount,ro /

reboot
---- commands end ----

With the reboot you will now have a ssh/scp access on port 9122. After login run:
/data/bin/ash
to give you a full featured shell environment.

Two files are updated
1) /etc/inittab which starts the sshd server;
2) /etc/init.d/mount-fs.sh which makes the /dev rw and has hooks to pivot the root system on boot.
