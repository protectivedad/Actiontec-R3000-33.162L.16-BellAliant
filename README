Make sure to install i386 libraries for fakeroot. On Ubuntu these are stored in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libfakeroot which requires:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libfakeroot" fakeroot
This has been changed in the Makefile to use the system fakeroot with the added libraries so 32 bit programs work correctly.

Also bind /bin/bash to /bin/sh for compiling.
  sudo mount --bind /bin/bash /bin/sh

DO NOT USE THESE TO UPGRADE. THE CFE IS BAD AND THE HUB WILL BE DEAD!!!!!

This builds a special ubi file that can be used to pivot under the existing system early (or late) in the boot process.
